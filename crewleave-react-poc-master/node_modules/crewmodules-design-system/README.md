# Crewmodules design system

Design system for use in Jeppesen's crew applications.

## Getting started

Run the following commands in the `design-system`-directory to fetch the dependencies of the design system and start a development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

When making updates to components and their documentation the browser will automatically refresh. 

## Installing the design system

The design system is released with NPM to Artifactory.
To install it, first the NPM registry needs to be set to Jeppesen's Artifactory.

```bash
npm config set registry http://artifactory.service.cloud.jeppesensystems.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-all/
```

Then it's a simple matter of installing it and loading the CSS an icons with whatever tools you are using to build your project.

```bash
npm install crewmodules-design-system --save-dev
```
